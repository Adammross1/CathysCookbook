    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <div class="grey-line"></div>

    <div class="center-p">
      <p class="about-intro">This website was built to assist Cathy in
        getting nutrition despite
        her gastroparesis. The website
        can be
        used by anyone to help with meal preparation, but our biggest goal is to make juicing a little easier for
        Cathy.
        You can read Cathy's experience with gastroparesis below:</p>

    <div class="center-p">
      <p class="about">"I was diagnosed about 14 years ago. I was sent home from the hospital with a paper that
        explained
        my food
        choices going forward. My diet was 5 saltine crackers, beef broth, Gatorade, and ginger ale 3 times a day for
        the
        rest of my life. I gasped when I saw the details and told the nurse, "I'll die of malnutrition!" She pointed to
        the bottom of the page where it said warning, malnutrition will occur. The purpose of the diet was to have no
        fiber so gravity would carry the food through my body, as my stomach was paralyzed and couldn't process food. I
        refused to accept malnutrition as my constant companion. <br><br> I studied the Word of Wisdom as my first move.
        It said it
        was for the weakest of saints, and I assumed I was in that category, so I hoped there was something in there for
        me. I read all the cross-reference scriptures as well, and my takeaway was to try barley water, as the Word of
        Wisdom mentioned barley for man. That was the beginning of doing a lot of research and turning my kitchen into a
        lab, experimenting with many foods, finding ways to get nutrition into my system. I've experienced a lot of "not
        going to work for me" experiments and got myself in some pain and sick, but as the years have gone on, I've
        found
        foods I can juice and make into tea that not only get vitamins into me but also are healing my body. <br><br>
        The
        last time
        I went to the gastroenterologist, he said I was rocking it compared to my contemporaries who are atrophying and
        angry (sadly, probably hangry, you get miserably hungry) and said to keep doing what I'm doing. It's not the
        protocol from the doctor but the Word of Wisdom juices that have helped me so much. I miss solid food a lot, and
        especially in the beginning, I would cry at times as I smelled food cooking and it was not for me. I especially
        miss salad. It has too much fiber. When I'm healed, whether in this life or the next, the first thing I'm going
        to
        do is go to the biggest salad bar and eat a little of EVERYTHING! Yeehaw! In the meantime, I'm thrilled with the
        benefits of juicing." <br><br>- Cathy Ross</p>
